# What Encourages You?

Welcome to the best form you will ever see in your life. 

Firstly, let me introduce myself as some of you may not know me.

My name is John and I'm a Sold Out disciple. I was baptised June 18th, 2024 and since I've been baptised it's been difficult but it's not a decision I would change for anything, I love to live for God, I love to try new things for God, I love to live my life so God can be glorified. 

    If this sounds like you at all, give me a message on my instagram @.

Anyway, into why you're here!

## Why did I create this?

Well, as you can tell when you first came into the kingdom, there was a question you heard a lot that you probably have never heard before; "What encourages you?"
    I know! What does this even mean? 
This is why I've created this small wesbite/form, so you can have a better understanding of what this question means, you have some options to select and you can put input your own answers.
